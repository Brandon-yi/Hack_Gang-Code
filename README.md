Our Project, Food4u is a way for users to input recipes, and prices of those recipes to see how much a certain food item costs. It's helpful because say a certain user wants to make a recipe with a certain amount of money, they can simply type in the budget they have, the recipe name, and find other users who have inputted recipes into a data base with prices to find a fit. Once a fit is found the user can copy and paste the link into a search bar and see where they got the recipe from. It's an efficient way to make the foods you love, at the prices you want.
